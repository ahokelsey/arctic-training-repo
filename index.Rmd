Load Salmon Escapement data from KNB
**tryCatch** says first try this and if not, catch this option. 
**Error** is a specific if statements for when there are errors.
The deleted **message** would have been used to alert users of the problem(s).
```{r}
data_url <- "https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/knb.92020.1"
# data_url <- "https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Af119a05b-bbe7-4aea-93c6-85434dcb1c5e"
esc <- tryCatch(
  #Line 29 says use local copy, if it does not exist then go to webpage.  
  read.csv("data/escapement.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE),
    error=function(cond) {
        esc <- read.csv(url(data_url, method = "libcurl"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
        return(esc)
    }
)

head(esc)
```

Prepare the dataset for calculating medians:
- Summarize daily escapment across rivers within a region.
- Group by species, region, year and location, since we will be calculating a median by those.
- Summarize daily totals of escapement.
- Group by species
- Summarize the mean escapement.
```{r}
median_esc <- esc %>% 
  separate(sampleDate, c("Year", "Month", "Day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  group_by(Species, SASAP.Region, Year, Location) %>% 
  summarize(escapement = sum(DailyCount)) %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(median_escapement = median(escapement))


head(median_esc)
```


Plot results using *ggplot* which uses a **+** instead of **%>%** which *tidyr* uses.
```{r}
ggplot(median_esc, aes(Species, median_escapement)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

```


Put unique location results into a table using **datatable**.
```{r}
locations <- esc %>% 
  distinct(Location, Latitude, Longitude) %>% 
  drop_na()
datatable(locations)

```


Create a map using **leaflet**. Shapefiles can also bee added with addPolygon and addLine.
```{r}
leaflet(locations) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(~ Longitude, ~ Latitude, popup = ~ Location)

```


To add an OSM use **addTiles**. Use **addMarkers** for the locations and are based on lat long.
```{r}
locs <- locations %>% mutate(Longitude = abs(Longitude) * -1)

leaflet(locs) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(~ Longitude, ~ Latitude, popup = ~ Location)

```

Add fish marker from "https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/dining-and-food/32/fish-512.png"
```{r}

# Use a custom marker so Leaflet doesn't try to grab the marker images from 
# its CDN (this was brought up in 
# https://github.com/NCEAS/sasap-training/issues/22)
markerIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/dining-and-food/32/fish-512.png",
  iconWidth = 25, iconHeight = 41,
  iconAnchorX = 12, iconAnchorY = 41,
  shadowUrl = "https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/dining-and-food/32/fish-512.png",
  shadowWidth = 41, shadowHeight = 41,
  shadowAnchorX = 13, shadowAnchorY = 41
)

leaflet(locs) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(~ Longitude, ~ Latitude, popup = ~ Location, icon = markerIcon)


```
